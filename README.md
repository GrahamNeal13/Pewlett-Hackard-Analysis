# Summary
## Possible Solutions to the "silver tsunami" issue. 
Based on these queries and seeing the results we see that there are 36,619 eligible retirees.  Which based on the departmental breakdown, the Development Department will be the most effected by this trend, which has 9,281 possible vacancies.  If these employees do decide to retire within a year of this report then we are looking at a huge problem.  
Luckily we have 1,550 eligible employees for our mentorship program.  This makes starting the mentorship program as soon as possible the best solution for training our less experienced employees and maintaining the level of quality workforce that we enjoy now.  I would also recommend instituting a new hire policy which will begin filling some of the vacancies in the departments most effected by retirement.  Also the position "Senior Engineer" will be greatly affected by the "silver tsunami" so we must make sure to train our existing engineers so that when the retirees do decide to leave the company we have trained and experienced employees who can also share the knowledge with any new employees we have hired.  Another option is to create lessons based on the more senior employees' knowledge base so that we have a "textbook" to help teach the younger employees.  This would provide us with the experience and re-usability of the lessons to train a new generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees.  There is no stopping time so making sure we are prepared for the coming loss of so many great employees is the best way to keep Pewlett-Hackard quality without having to close any locations or fall behind on any current projects.  
Thank you for your time and let's all work together to keep Pewlett-Hackard a great company.
